Hey there!
This is the very first game Iâ€™ve ever built â€” made with love, JavaScript, and lots of trial-and-error ğŸ˜…. Itâ€™s a simple endless runner inspired by Sonic, with rings to collect and baddies to dodge (or smash!).

Not perfect, not fancy â€” but a big step in my game dev journey. So be kind, have fun, and donâ€™t judge the bugs too hard ğŸ« ğŸ’™
